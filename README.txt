This directory contains all the class files and jar file needed to run
the JustChords program.



INSTALLATION

Create a directory (let's call it %INSTALL%), then

       cd %INSTALL%
       unzip %WHEREVER%\jc.zip

That's it. You should also have Java (at least version 1.8).
If you like, add %INSTALL% to your PATH.



RUNNING

	jc [options...] [XML file]

Try --overview, or launch it with no options and use the Help menu.



SOURCES

Unzip the src.zip file somewhere and import that directory into the
IdeaJ IDE. Feel free to make changes, fix bugs, etc.  Please drop
me a line if you add functionality or fix a bug.



PROBLEMS?

Contact me at weath@weath.net and I'll help you troubleshoot.

Enjoy!
